PHP JS HTML5 capture gps ip and photos
Just copy and past the code on a web server. 
Change the index.php header, the time in seconds for foward the page, and the place where it goes.
The web-site will take a photo, the gps location and the ip of the target.
You can perform better phishing sites putting these code in others phishing pages.
